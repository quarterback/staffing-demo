# Nautilus Demo Script for Contest Submission

**Total Time: 3-4 minutes**

---

## Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:15)
*[Start on Dashboard view]*

"Hi! I'm excited to show you Nautilus - an AI-powered staffing tool that's transforming how delivery teams manage cross-functional projects. If you've ever struggled with staffing designers, engineers, product managers, and program managers across multiple projects, this tool is for you."

---

## Problem Statement (0:15 - 0:30)
*[Still on Dashboard]*

"Traditional staffing is reactive, manual, and siloed. Leaders spend hours in spreadsheets trying to figure out who's available, what skills they have, and which projects need people. Nautilus makes this intelligent, proactive, and seamless."

---

## Navigation Innovation (0:30 - 0:45)
*[Hover over navigation, show dropdowns]*

"First, notice the smart navigation. Instead of overwhelming users with a dozen random tabs, I've organized everything by workflow - Core functions like Dashboard and Staffing are always visible, while related tools are grouped logically in Resources, Planning, and Analytics dropdowns."

---

## Dashboard Overview (0:45 - 1:00)
*[Highlight key metrics cards]*

"The dashboard gives you instant insights - total staff across all disciplines, utilization rates, available team members, and critical staffing needs. Everything a delivery leader needs at a glance."

---

## AI-Powered Staffing (1:00 - 1:30)
*[Navigate to Staffing, click on a request]*

"Here's where the AI magic happens. When I click on any staffing request, Nautilus analyzes our entire cross-functional team and surfaces the best candidates with confidence scores and trade-off explanations. No more guessing - the AI considers skills, availability, project history, and team dynamics."

*[Click on a request, show AI recommendations]*

"Look at this - it's recommending Sarah Chen with 89% confidence, showing exactly why she's a great fit and what the trade-offs are. I can assign her with one click."

---

## Cross-Functional Team Management (1:30 - 2:00)
*[Navigate to Projects view]*

"Nautilus isn't just for designers - it manages complete cross-functional teams. Here in Projects view, you can see entire project teams with designers, engineers, product managers, and program managers all in one place. Need to restaff someone? Just drag and drop."

*[Navigate to People view]*

"The People roster shows everyone across all disciplines, organized by availability. You can filter by any combination of skills, levels, or availability status."

---

## Smart Filtering & Planning (2:00 - 2:30)
*[Demonstrate filters, navigate to Team Builder]*

"The filtering system works consistently across every view - same interface whether you're looking at people, projects, or requests. And the Team Builder lets you plan future team compositions with drag-and-drop functionality."

*[Show Team Builder briefly, then go to Forecast]*

"The forecast view helps you plan 6 months ahead - seeing upcoming project needs and staff transitions before they become urgent."

---

## Analytics & Integrations (2:30 - 3:00)
*[Navigate to Analytics dropdown, show Navametrics]*

"For data-driven leaders, Navametrics provides deep analytics on utilization, skills gaps, and staffing trends."

*[Navigate to Integrations]*

"And it integrates with your existing tools - pulling staffing requests directly from Jira and sending notifications through Slack."

---

## Technical Excellence (3:00 - 3:15)
*[Show the smooth interactions, maybe the tour]*

"Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with a full Supabase backend including Edge Functions and real-time updates. The interface is responsive, accessible, and includes an interactive tour to help new users get started."

---

## Closing Impact (3:15 - 3:30)
*[Back to Dashboard]*

"Nautilus turns staffing from a reactive scramble into a strategic advantage. It's not just a tool - it's a complete workflow transformation that helps teams deliver better projects with happier, more efficiently allocated people."

*[Pause on logo or final dashboard view]*

"Thank you for watching - I'd love to show you more!"
